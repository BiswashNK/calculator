Features

    Addition (+)
    Subtraction (-)
    Multiplication (*)
    Division (/)
    Exponentiation (^)
    Square Root (√)
    Factorial (!)
    Negation ((-))
    Decimal input (.)
    Clear input (Clear)
    Delete last digit (Del)
    Supports chaining operations
    Displays results in a non-editable text field

Technologies Used

    Java: Programming language for the logic
    Swing: GUI toolkit for Java
    AWT: For layout and event handling
    Event Listeners: Used to handle button clicks and actions
